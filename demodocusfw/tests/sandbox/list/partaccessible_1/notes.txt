Example Title: List_Medium_Partaccessible_1

Description
--------------------------------
Similar to list_medium_accessible_1, but now only the first and third bullet points have click and keyup handlers
to deal with keyboard users. The second and fourth list items only have the click handler, and thus cannot recieve enter
or spacebar events.

Expected Results
--------------------------------
God and norm bots should be able to reach every state.

Keyboard bot will not be able to reach the states where the second and fourth list items are expanded.
