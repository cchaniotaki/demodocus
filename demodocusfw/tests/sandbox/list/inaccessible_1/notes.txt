Example Title: List_Easy_Inaccessible_1

Description
-------------------------
In this example you can click on each of the ingredients and it will toggle some dropdown info.
Unlike simple_list, this example's start state has explicit styling set so that the page source after opening and closing an item will be identical to the start state.

Expected Results
-------------------------
The God and Human bots should catch the change in styling for the sub bullets.

The keyboard user should be unable to interact with the list items since they are not tabbable.

Interestingly, a user with JAWS is able to interact with the list since JAWS uses its own internal focus.
