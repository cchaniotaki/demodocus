Example Title: List_Easy_Accessible_1

Description
-------------------------
This is a purely static version of the list example with no interactions. This will be used to make sure the
bot is not finding states that do not exist.

Expected Results
-------------------------
All bots should find that none of the components are interactable and that there is only one state.
