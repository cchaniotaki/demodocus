Example Title: List_Medium_Accessible_2

Description
--------------------------------
Similar to list_medium_accessible_1, but now the children only open, but don't close.

Expected Results
--------------------------------
All bots should be able to interact and use these lists, and find the different states. There should be multiple
edges going from a state where the list is open and closed since there are multiple ways to complete the action.
