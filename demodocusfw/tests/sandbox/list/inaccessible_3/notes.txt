Example Title: List_Easy_Inaccessible_1

Description
-------------------------
Same as inaccessible_2, except that the sub menu under the first bullet now has keyboard controls.

Expected Results
-------------------------
The God and Human bots should catch the change in styling for the sub bullets.

The keyboard user should be unable to interact with the list items since they are not tabbable.

Interestingly, a user with JAWS is able to interact with the list since JAWS uses its own internal focus.
